1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

To import React object that we will use to render with React


2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

[object] since it's a plain JavaScript object


3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```

Need to be nested in one object (e.g. <div>)


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

Declarative - what should be done, imperative - how


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

To be divided into elements that can be combined
